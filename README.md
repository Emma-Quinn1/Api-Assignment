# API-Assignment

A Node.js project where I utilize REST APIs to create MySQL databases with Prisma for a school assignment.

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Additionally, you will need an API testing tool such as Postman to interact with the API endpoints.

Import the provided Postman-collection (Photo_app.postman_collection.json) to see all endpoints and data.

Install all dependencies by running `npm install`. Create your own .env file using the .env.example

run `npm start` to start server.
